Compound is a DEFI Protocol.

It works in 2 ways: like a bank and like a Exchange.

In this JavaScript file I am using Compound Protocol API calls in order to achieve some protocol funcionality.

Check the JS source code for more information.

Feel free to use it.

**Notice: **

In order the JavaScript file works, you have to provide in the JS code:

1. Your private key address (Ropsten).

2. Your own Infura node address, like: 
"wss://ropsten.infura.io/ws/v3/..."
